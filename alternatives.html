            <h2>Recommandations of using BHA</h2>
            <p>Strict laws control how much BHA can be used in food, cosmetics, and other products to keep people and the environment safe. These rules make sure that only small, safe amounts of BHA are allowed in products. For example, organizations like the FDA set a limit on how much BHA people can safely eat each day, which is about 0.5 mg for every kilogram of body weight. Some places have even stricter rules and might ban BHA in certain items if there are safer options available. Laws also require labels to show if a product has BHA so that people can make informed choices. These strict rules help protect health and encourage companies to find safer alternatives in the future.
