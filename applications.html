            <h2>Applications of BHA</h2>
            <p>BHA is widely used across multiple industries due to its effectiveness in preventing oxidation. In the food industry, it is added to products such as snacks, cereals, baked goods, and even some types of packaged meat. By keeping fats and oils stable, BHA helps maintain the flavor, texture, and freshness of these foods.</p>
            <p>In cosmetics, BHA is found in products like lipsticks and other skincare items, where it helps keep the formulations stable and effective over time. The pharmaceutical industry also uses BHA to extend the shelf life of certain medicines, ensuring that they remain safe and effective for patients. Additionally, BHA is sometimes used in packaging materials and industrial products, protecting them from damage caused by oxidation during storage and transportation.</p>
