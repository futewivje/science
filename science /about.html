        <h2>What is BHA?</h2>
        <p>
          BHA (Butylated hydroxyanisole) is a synthetic antioxidant used in many
          everyday products. It is made up of a mixture of two isomers, both
          sharing the molecular formula
          <strong>C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>2</sub></strong
          >.

        <h2>Structure and Function</h2>
        <p>
          The structure of BHA includes a ring with a hydroxyl group, which is
          important in its ability to prevent oxidation. Oxidation occurs when
          fats and oils break down due to exposure to oxygen, leading to
          unpleasant odors, flavors, and decreased shelf life.

        <h2>How Does BHA Work?</h2>
        <p>
          BHA works by neutralizing free radicals, which are unstable molecules
          that trigger oxidation. This makes BHA highly valuable in preserving
          the quality and safety of items, including food, cosmetics, and
          medications.
