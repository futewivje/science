            <h2>Health Concerns of BHA</h2>
            <p>BHA is generally considered safe within regulated limits, some studies had said the concerns about its potential health risks. Research on animals has shown that very high levels of BHA exposure could increase the risk of cancer, particularly in the forestomach of rodents. However, it is important to note that humans do not have a forestomach, so the health concerns caused by BHA is still debated. Some scientists argue that the small amounts of BHA allowed in food and cosmetics are unlikely to cause harm, while others believe more research is needed to fully understand its long-term effects. This ongoing debate highlights the importance of carefully balancing the benefits and risks of using BHA. 
              So, having a small amount of BHA should be acceptable for your body, but still needs to control the amount of the BHA daily.
