            <h2>Recommandations of using BHA</h2>
            <p>For consumers, the key to is to minimizing potential risks associated with BHA is awareness. Reading product labels carefully can help identify whether BHA is present in foods, cosmetics, or other items. Choosing fresh, whole foods and reducing the consumption of heavily processed snacks can also help limit exposure. In the cosmetics industry,  products that use natural antioxidants instead of synthetic ones may be a safer choice. Manufacturers and regulators should continue monitoring scientific research to update safety guidelines as new information becomes available. 
              BHA should be used under strict rules.
