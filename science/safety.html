            <h2>Safety of BHA</h2>
            <p>The safety of BHA has been evaluated by several regulatory organizations around the world, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and Health Canada. These organizations have set limits on how much BHA can be used in products and have determined acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels for consumers. For example, BHA is typically set at 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. regulations can differ depending on the country or the region. While some countries allow BHA in specific amounts, others have stricter limits or ban it in certain products. Manufacturers and consumers must follow these guidelines to ensure the safe use of BHA in daily life.
              That is why we should use the BHA under the right circumstances and strictions.
