            <h2>Environmental impact fom the BHA</h2>
            <p>In addition to potential health concerns, BHA may also affect the environment. When BHA is released into the environment, it can stay for a long time because it breaks down slowly. This can lead to its accumulation in soil, water, air, and living organisms. Studies have suggested that BHA might be toxic to some aquatic species, which raises concerns about its impact on ecosystems, especially in areas with high levels of industrial or agricultural runoff. While regulations exist to control how much BHA can be used and disposed of, more research is needed to understand its full environmental concerns
              Overall, these are just the predictions but without being verified, no one can say that BHA doesn't cause any environmental issues.
              
              So, having a small amount of BHA should be acceptable for your body, but still needs to control the amount of the BHA daily.
